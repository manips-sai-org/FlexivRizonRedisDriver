# This program executes a given process (PROCESS_NAME) on a
# given range of CPUs (CPU_NUM_LIST). First, the desired CPUs
# are set to performance mode. Then, the process is launched
# with real-time priority and minimum niceness. Ideally, the
# CPUs assigned for this process should be isolated.
#
# This program must be launched with the bash interpreter
# or executed directly:
# -- Make the script executable with $ chmod +x SCRIPT_NAME
# -- Run the script with ./SCRIPT_NAME
#
# This program must be run as root.

# USER INPUTS
PROCESS_NAME=redis-server # process to be launched
CPU_NUM_LIST=0 # range of CPUs to use for process

# ensure the script is run with bash

# ensure the script is run with root privilege
# $ sudo ./SCRIPT_NAME
